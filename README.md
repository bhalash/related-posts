# Sheepie
Sheepie is the WordPress theme for my frequently-renamed [personal blog](http://www.bhalash.com), named in honour of my son's stuffed toy.

## Description
Sheepie is the WordPress theme for my personal site, although if you are feeling adventurous, you can extract the CSS to use yourself for a different CMS. As my personal site theme, it is in a permanent state of flux. Features may be missing, the appearance may be broken and this could quite possibly trash your WordPress installation depending on what point in time I commit code to the repository.

As much as every GPL project carries a disclaimer about reliability and liability, you should truly consider "caveat emptor" here.
